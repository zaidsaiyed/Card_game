# Blackjack Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack using Python 3. The game consists of a deck of cards, two players (a player and a dealer), and the goal is to have a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer's without going over 21.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x

## How to Run the Game

1.  Clone the repository or download the code as a zip file and extract it.
2.  Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is saved.
3.  Run the following command:

pythonCopy code

`python blackjack.py` 

4.  Follow the instructions on the screen to play the game.

## How to Play

1.  At the beginning of each round, both the player and dealer are dealt two cards from the deck. The player's cards are dealt face up, while the dealer's first card is dealt face down (known as the "hole" card).
2.  The player must decide whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
3.  If the player's hand goes over 21, they "bust" and automatically lose the round.
4.  Once the player has decided to stand, the dealer reveals their hole card and continues to draw cards until their hand value is 17 or higher.
5.  If the dealer's hand goes over 21, they "bust" and the player automatically wins the round.
6.  If neither the player nor the dealer busts, the winner is determined by who has the higher hand value. If the player and dealer have the same hand value, it's a tie.

## Code Overview

The code consists of three classes: `Card`, `Deck`, and `Player`.

The `Card` class represents a single playing card, with a suit and a value.

The `Deck` class represents a deck of playing cards, with methods to create the deck, shuffle the cards, and deal cards to players.

The `Player` class represents a player in the game, with methods to draw cards from the deck and show their hand.

The `game` class ties everything together and implements the game logic. It starts by creating a new deck, shuffling it, and dealing two cards each to the player and dealer. It then prompts the player to hit or stand, and continues drawing cards until the player stands or busts. Once the player is done, it reveals the dealer's hand and draws cards for the dealer until their hand value is 17 or higher. Finally, it determines the winner of the round based on the hand values of the player and dealer. The game continues until the player chooses to stop playing.
